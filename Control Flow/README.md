<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Control Flow</b></h1>

 Welcome to this lesson on Control Flow! Control flow is the sequence in which your code is run. Here, we'll learn about several tools in Python we can use to affect our code's control flow:

    Conditional Statements
    Boolean Expressions
    For and While Loops
    Break and Continue
    Zip and Enumerate
    List Comprehensions

- you'll learn how to add more functionality to your code by being able to use conditional statements and loops.
- You'll learn how to implement decision-making with if statements, repeat code with for and while loops, exit or skip loops with break and continue, use helpful built-in functions like zip and enumerate, and combine some of these concepts in concise list comprehensions.
- With these tools, you'll be able to bring together the data types and operators you learned from the previous lesson in more complex and creative ways.
