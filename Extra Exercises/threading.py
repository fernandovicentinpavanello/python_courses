# â†’ thread =  a flow of execution, Like a separate order of instructions;

#             allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter at any time.

# cpu bound = program/task spends most of its time waiting for internal events

# io bound = program/task spends most of its time waiting for external events
#            (user input, web scraping) use multithreading
