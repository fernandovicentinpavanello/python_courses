# Python

 - Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in industry. It's a powerful, general purpose language with applications ranging from web development to data science. In this course you'll learn how to apply Python and good programming practices to solve practical problems.

 - Keep in mind: 

    - First, unlike languages like SQL, Python is case sensitive, meaning these two words mean two different things;

    - Second, spacing is important in Python. Since it isn't very heavy on syntax like other languages, it relies a lot on spacing, which can be confusing at first (not really), but really nice and clean when you get the hang of it.

    - Third, there will be times you get errors in this course. 
        ### â†’ Keep in mind, Errors don't make you a bad programmer. It's just a computer telling you it doesn't understand. 
        
        Use error messages to help you learn how to write code that can be interpreted the way you wish.
