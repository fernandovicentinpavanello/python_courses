Errors and Exceptions

    Syntax errors occur when Python can’t interpret our code, since we didn’t follow the correct syntax for Python. These are errors you’re likely to get when you make a typo, or you’re first starting to learn Python.

    Exceptions occur when unexpected things happen during execution of a program, even if the code is syntactically correct. There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python, and you can see which exception is thrown in the error message.

→ ValueError: An object of the correct type but inappropriate value is passed as input to a built-in operation or function;

→ AssertionError: An assert statement fails;

→ IndexError: A sequence subscript is out of range;

→ KeyError: A key can't be found in a dictionary;

→ TypeError: An object of an unsupported type is passed as input to an operation funciton.
