Functions

Welcome to this lesson on Functions! You'll learn about:

    Defining Functions
    Variable Scope
    Documentation
    Lambda Expressions
    Iterators and Generators

You can think about functions as a way to take what you have already learned how to do, and put it in a holder that allows you to use it over and over again in an easy to use container.
